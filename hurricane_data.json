After heading southwestward, it turned to the northwest and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2. Agatha maintained its course and steadily intensified. It reached hurricane intensity on June 3 while located about 170 mi (270 km) southwest ofZihuatanejo. Hurricane Agatha started weakening thereafter, becoming a tropical storm on June 4 and a depression on June 5. It dissipated shortly afterwards. At this time, Agatha was located about 140 mi (230 km) south of theTres Marias Islands.",
            "Even though Agatha passed close to Mexico as it weakened, no impact is known to have been caused.Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called thePolynesian Diakan. A Greek freighter en route fromPago PagotoTerminal Island, California, thePolynesian Diakanbegan flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel.The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due tocargo shiftingand not the weather.The crew was rescued by theUnited States Coast Guard.Three members required hospitalization.After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank nearSan Clemente Islandon June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of cannedtunawith it. The reason for the sinking was unknown."

It started accelerating as it turned towards the northwest, then west, and eventually to the southwest. Bridget weakened into a tropical depression on July 2 and dissipated the next day.

It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved out to sea.On August 25, Ilsa turned westward and rapidly weakened. It fell to tropical storm intensity on August 26. Later that day, while still maintaining winds ofgale-force, Ilsa ceased being a tropical cyclone.Ilsa's remnants continued out over the openPacific Ocean.The remains of Ilsa eventually interacted with another weather system. That triggered the development of the unnamed hurricane of August 31–September 5",
            "Hurricane Ilsa caused no casualties or damage.As the unnamed hurricane formed from Ilsa's remnants,Ilsa and the latter system are unofficially the same tropical cyclone. Indeed, this year's seasonal report from theRedwood CityEastern Pacific Hurricane Center, in theMonthly Weather Reviewincludes a brief discussion of the unnamed hurricane in the report's section on Hurricane Ilsa.Neither theCentral Pacific Hurricane Centernor the officialHURDAT\"best track\" database of tropical cyclone location and intensity data explicitly considers them the same. Hence, as far as official records matter, Ilsa and the unnamed hurricane of August 31 – September 5 are different tropical cyclones."

            "The remnants of Hurricane Ilsa interacted with a mid-level trough to produce a new low-level circulation on August 31, about 930 miles (1,500 km) northeast of Hawaii. The new system absorbed the remnants of Ilsa as it moved westward. Thunderstorms increased around the low, resembling asubtropical cycloneby September 1. Its track over warmer waters caused the storm to transition into a tropical storm on September 2, by which time the convection organized into rainbands. By that time, the storm was about 685 miles (1,102 km) north of the Hawaiian island ofKauai. The storm quickly developed acentral dense overcast, and by 00:00 UTC on September 3Dvorak classificationsbegan on the cyclone. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the north and northeast. Around that time, the storm developed an eye in the center of the convection, suggesting that it intensified into a hurricane late on September 3, located about 1,170 miles (1,885 km) south ofAlaska. It was a small system, measuring about 85 miles (140 km) in diameter.A nearby ship reported sustained winds of 63 mph (102 km/h), while another nearby ship reported a pressure of 1003mbar(29.6inHg), with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5 mbar (0.40 inHg), suggesting a minimum pressure of under 990 mbar (29 inHg).After maintaining hurricane status for about 18 hours, the storm weakened due to strong wind shear from the approaching cold front. Early on September 5, the cyclone becameextratropicalin theGulf of Alaska, while located about 315 miles (510 km) southwest ofJuneau, Alaska. On the same day, the circulation was rapidly absorbed by the frontal system,and the remnants quickly reached the coast ofBritish Columbia.The remnants of the storm turned southeastward, and the low was last tracked definitively to a point north ofMontana."
